# mangroveID

The MangroveID is a powerful tool for mangrove plant enthusiasts that can help identify the species of a leaf just by taking a photo.

The app uses advanced machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques to accurately predict the species of the leaf. The app is developed using the Kotlin programming language in Android Studio, which provides a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality. Once the app is installed on the user's mobile device, it can access the device's camera to capture an image of the leaf.

The captured image is then processed using the app's built-in machine learning model, which has been trained on a small dataset of leaf images from various plant species by using transfer learning. The model extracts key features from the image and compares them to a database of known leaf species to determine the closest match.

The app provides users with the predicted species name, along with a brief description and a high-quality image of the plant. The MangroveID is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all. It has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to use even for those with no prior experience in plant identification. The app's machine learning model is continually updated to improve its accuracy and expand its database of known species. Overall, the MangroveID app is an essential tool for anyone interested in plant identification, providing accurate and reliable species predictions with just a click of a button.
